# Expiration and Recovery

## Alerts

The billing system will send alert notifications to customers.

For resources manually submitted for recovery by the account manager: An alert will be sent to the customer within 10 minutes.

For resources automatically recovered:

- For monthly and yearly billing: An alert will be sent on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day in the morning.
- For hourly billing: An alert will be sent at the next 10 o'clock.

### Renewal

If you renew within 7 days after the alert is issued, you can continue to use it normally, and the original configuration will be retained.

## Recovery Strategy

If no renewal is made after the alert is issued, the resources will be deleted 7 days after the first alert is issued.

## User Deletion

If the user deletes the WAF during the usage period, the equivalent cost of the time used in the current month will be charged, and the remaining cost will be returned to the user's account.
