# Number of Connections

The number of connections displays the concurrent connections and new connection rate (CPS) of the protected IP. You can select the required time period for all domains or a single domain.

!> Note:  
The connection report is queried based on the IP. When the number of IPs used is too large, the query speed will be affected. Selecting all domains is to query the connection status of all protected IPs; selecting a specific domain is to query the connection status of the protected IP used by this domain. If you focus on the connection status of a single domain, please enable the exclusive IP option for this domain.
