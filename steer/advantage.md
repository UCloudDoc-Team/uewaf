# Product Advantages

## Low Latency and More Stable

UWAF is based on BGP line access, which is stable in quality, has millisecond-level response, low latency, and provides multi-line node disaster recovery and intelligent optimal path mobilization. It is more stable and reliable while having low latency for business.

## Self-Improving Rule System

The mainstream WAF is still based on feature matching, but in the face of increasingly complex and diverse attacks, the rule system based on feature matching often cannot provide good protection. However, UWAF can also be based on machine learning, using the excellent generalization ability and automatic learning ability of the intelligent detection engine, it can be organically combined with the rule system to provide more solid security for customer websites.

## Automated Elastic Expansion Capability

Facing the uncertainty of business, UWAF has the ability of automated elastic expansion, using UCloud's powerful public cloud resource pool as support. When encountering CC attacks or sudden business situations, it can quickly expand its own services, so there will be no performance bottleneck issues.

## Strong Collaborative Defense Capability

UCloud uses its powerful cloud-side intelligence collection capabilities, combined with the intelligence of other intelligence manufacturers, to filter a large number of malicious access requests using the intelligence library on UWAF.

## 7x24 Hours Expert Service

All users who purchase UWAF can enjoy 7x24 hours of free expert service. For some complex attacks, when the machine or algorithm cannot make accurate judgments and blocks, UCloud's security experts can intervene to assist, guide the attack scenario according to the hacker's attack methods, and make targeted defensive measures.
