# Global Blacklist

This blacklist is a global blacklist, different from the [domain blacklist](/uewaf/features/expand/black_list), the global blacklist applies to all domains. The matching action of the global blacklist only supports interception, does not support captcha, and does not support specifying a valid time.

You can customize and add the IP addresses that need to be blacklisted, support for individual IP addresses, IP address segments, and IP subnets (CIDR format). You can also quickly reset the global blacklist, that is, delete all the rules in the global blacklist.
