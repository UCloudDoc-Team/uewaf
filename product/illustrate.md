# Product Overview

UCloud Web Application Firewall (abbreviated as UWAF) is a cloud-based distributed reverse proxy application firewall, which uses the cloud with more resources and higher throughput to judge and filter traffic. In the increasingly severe network security situation, UWAF, which has high availability, efficient interception of malicious traffic, access statistical analysis, application health status monitoring and other functional features, and can be flexibly managed through the console or API, is the ideal solution for Web security for enterprise users in various industries.

UWAF can intercept most Web attacks to protect your Web applications. These attacks can reduce the availability, security, or cause abnormal consumption of your applications. Unlike traditional application firewalls, you can pay as you go, use it as soon as you need it, quickly access, and manage conveniently. You can also combine UWAF with other security products such as DDoS protection services as part of a network security solution to obtain more comprehensive security protection. In addition, UWAF can also meet the requirements of equal protection compliance.
