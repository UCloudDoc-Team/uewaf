- # Feature Description

  UCloud Web Application Firewall (UWAF) is used to protect against internal and external security threats to website applications. Compatible with high-defense service (UDDoS), in addition to the protection provided by the high-defense service, it can also protect against common network attacks such as injections, command executions, CC, etc.

  ## Basic Concepts

  The enterprise-level WEB application firewall is deployed before the source server. After purchasing, the CNAME provided by UWAF is configured in the CNAME resolution of the domain name, and then all public network traffic will pass through UWAF. Malicious attack traffic will be filtered, and normal traffic can be transmitted to the source server through UWAF, thereby ensuring the safety of the source server.

  ## Web Application Attack Protection

  Comprehensively protect against the following types of attacks: SQL injection, XSS cross-site, WebShell, command injection, illegal HTTP protocol requests, common Web server vulnerability attacks, unauthorized access to core files, path traversal, etc. Provide backdoor isolation protection and scanning protection functions.

  ## Accurate Access Control Rules

  - Provides a friendly configuration console interface, supports the combination of common HTTP fields such as IP, URL, Referer, User-Agent, creates a powerful precise access control strategy, and can support anti-theft chain, website background protection and other protection scenarios.
  - Link with common Web attack protection, CC protection and other security modules to create a multi-layer comprehensive protection mechanism, and can identify trusted and malicious traffic according to needs.

  ## Malicious CC Attack Protection

  - Control the access frequency of a single source IP, support redirect jump verification, and human-machine recognition, etc.
  - For massive slow request attacks, identify based on statistical response codes and URL request distribution, abnormal Referer and User-Agent characteristics, and combine with website precise access control for comprehensive protection.

  ## Rich Reports

  Provide rich attack and access reports to keep you informed of the website status.

  ## Black and White List

  - Blacklist: Block specified IP or IP segments.
  - Whitelist: Allow specified IP or IP segments.

  ## Log Query and Download

  - UWAF supports real-time queries within 3 days, online query of 10,000 logs. Provide log download within 7 days (attack log and access log).
  - If the user starts the log extension package service, it supports a maximum of 180 days of log download service (free for flagship users and above).

  ## Alarm Management

  - Regularly send alarm summary information of UWAF-related domain names to the user's mailbox to remind of risks.
  - Real-time sending of alarms when a large number of rules are triggered in a short period of time for UWAF-related domain names, sending alarms to the user's mailbox or mobile phone to remind of the risk of security incidents.
  - Real-time sending of alarms when the source station of UWAF-related domain names does not respond normally, sending to the user's mailbox to remind the user to check the source station.
  - Real-time sending of alarms for the request response status of UWAF-related domain names, such as the proportion of status codes above 499 in the overall request is greater than 30%. Then an alarm will be sent to the user's mailbox or mobile phone.
