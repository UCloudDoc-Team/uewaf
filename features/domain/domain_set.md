# Domain Management

The domain management interface can [add domains](#AddDomain) to UWAF for Web application access security protection, and you can also view the added [domain list](#DomainList) and configure the added domains.

The following is based on the SaaS version of UWAF.

## Add Domain

You can add domains to UWAF. When accessing the domain through UWAF, UWAF will perform security detection and rule judgment on the traffic.
The domain is added as shown in the figure below. Only the domain that needs to be accessed by WAF is filled in the domain column, no need to write the port, the public IP address or domain of the source station is filled in the source IP column, and the source port is filled in after selecting the corresponding protocol. If the same source station has multiple ports or there are multiple source stations, click ⊕ to add a column and fill in or select the corresponding configuration, click ⊖ to delete the column.

Note:  
If there are multiple different ports, UWAF will return to the port actually accessed by the client.  
If there are multiple source stations on the same port, UWAF will use a polling method to return to the source.

### Parameter Description

| Parameter                                         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Domain Name                                       | The domain name that needs protection                        |
| Origin IP                                         | The origin address of the domain name, select the protocol type and fill in the corresponding port |
| Load Mode                                         | The load balancing algorithm that takes effect in the scenario of multi-origin load, <br>● Weighted Round Robin: The polling is conducted according to the proportion of each origin's weight to the total weight of the origins. Nodes with higher weights occupy more polling shares, and the number of requests increases. Nodes with lower weights occupy fewer polling shares, and the number of requests decreases.<br>● IP Hash: The client's IP address is hashed, and requests are distributed to different origin servers, ensuring that requests from the same client are always assigned to the same origin server. |
| Deployment Area                                   | The workspace generated by the domain name configuration     |
| [Working Mode](/uewaf/rule/mode)                  | The working mode of the domain name UWAF rules<br>● Blocking Mode: It will intercept and allow according to the default UWAF rules and user-defined UWAF rules, and generate security logs<br>● Alert Mode: It will generate security logs according to the default UWAF rules and user-defined UWAF rules, but will not intercept<br>● Allow Mode: It only serves as a traffic forwarding server, records access logs, all accesses will be allowed, and no attack log information will be generated |
| <div id="exclusive-ip"></div>Exclusive Defense IP | Consumes an exclusive IP point, assigns an exclusive defense IP to this domain name, this item can only be enabled when adding a domain name<br>The domain name with exclusive IP has better concurrent performance compared to the domain name with shared defense IP, and will not be affected when the shared defense IP is subjected to a 4-layer DDoS attack |
| Is there a proxy in front of WAF                  | Enable when using a third-party proxy (high defense, CDN, PATHX, etc.) in front of UWAF, and the request is forwarded by the proxy, causing UWAF to not get the real client IP address.<br>Enable this function and fill in the field that can accurately obtain the real client IP, so that UWAF can get the real client IP address |
| SSL Certificate                                   | When using the HTTPS protocol port, you need to upload the corresponding certificate. If there is a matching certificate, it will be listed. If the certificate is purchased from [USSL](/ussl/operate/buy) or the certificate is hosted on [USSL](/ussl/operate/upload), the certificate of the corresponding domain name will be automatically pulled when adding the HTTPS site. |
| HTTP Back to Source                               | After enabling, requests from HTTPS 443 port will be returned to the origin HTTP 80 port. **This item does not support HTTP back to source for non-443 ports, or back to source to non-80 ports** |
| HTTPS Redirect                                    | After enabling, UWAF will return a 301 redirect response to requests from HTTP 80 port, prompting the client to request HTTPS 443 port. **This item does not support redirection from non-80 ports, or redirection to non-443 ports** |
| HTTP2 Forwarding                                  | Enable the forwarding and security protection of HTTP 2.0 business, **this item needs to be enabled with HTTPS redirect at the same time** |
| Traffic Marking                                   | UWAF adds a custom request Header field in the back-to-source request header and sets it to a custom value to mark the traffic from UWAF |

## Domain List

You can conveniently view various information about the domains added to UWAF, such as business availability, resolution status, deployment region, working mode, number of attacks today, etc. You can also click the button behind the domain to further configure the domain.

### Parameter Description

| Parameter                                 | Description                                                  |

| Domain                                    | The protected domain that has been added                     |
| CNAME                                     | The CNAME protected domain assigned by UWAF. After successfully adding the domain, you need to resolve the original domain to this CNAME protected domain to introduce traffic into UWAF. See [Access SaaS version UWAF](/uewaf/use/access_uwaf) |

| Resolution Status                         | The DNS resolution status of the current CNAME record assigned by UWAF. Normal means it is resolved to the protection IP of UWAF; back to source means it is resolved to the source station, and the first one is taken if there are multiple source stations. |
| Deployment Region                         | The deployment region of the firewall domain, multiple deployment regions CNAME protected domain will resolve multiple IPs |
| [Working Mode](/uewaf/features/rule/mode) | The working mode of the UWAF rules for the domain            |
