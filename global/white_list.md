# Whitelist (Global)

This whitelist is a global whitelist, different from the [Domain Whitelist](/uewaf/features/expand/white_list), the global whitelist applies to all domains.

You can customize and add the IP addresses that need to be whitelisted, supporting individual IP addresses, IP address ranges, and IP subnets (CIDR format). You can also quickly reset the global whitelist, that is, delete all the rules in the global whitelist.
